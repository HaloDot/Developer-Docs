## 1. Intent Use Cases

With Halo Dot Link the exact same technology can be used for different use-cases. However, the integration is slightly different to allow us to distiguish the use cases. The use-cases, and their specific integration guides are:

* [Transactions / Payments Acceptance](transaction-intent-integration-guide.md)
* [TT3 / Debicheck](tt3-intent-integration-guide.md)
