# Getting Started with Intents

## 1. Intent Integration Methods

The Halo.Go application currently provides different mechanisms to integrate and try our payments solution depending on your use-case. The different methods are:

1. Android Intents Mechanism
2. Deeplinking Mechanism

Have a look at the image below as a guideline:

## 2. Intent Authorization

1. Retrieve your `Merchant ID` and `API Key` from the [Merchant Portal](https://go.merchantportal.prod.haloplus.io/).

**1. Retrieve details from the Merchant Portal**

_**Get Merchant ID**_

The `Merchant ID` can easily be found on the Halo.Go Portal. From the  Portal, navigate to Users. There, you will see your unique `Merchant ID`.&#x20;

_**Get x-api-key**_

In the user table generate your `API Key`. Note the warning pop-up when generating an `API Key`.

Since an `API Key`is a sensitive value, it is stored as an encrypted value in our database and only presented in clear text once during the initial retrieval. It is the responsibility of the user to keep their `API Key` safe.

## 3. Intent Use Cases

With Halo Dot the exact same technology can be used for different use cases. However, the integration is slightly different to allow us to distinguish the use cases. The use cases and their specific integration guides are:

* [Transactions / Payments Acceptance](../readme/transaction-app2app-integration-guide.md)
* [TT3 / Debicheck](../readme/tt3-app2app-integration-guide.md)
