## 1. Intent Use Cases ##

With Halo Dot Link the exact same technology can be used for different use-cases. However, the integration is slightly different to allow us to distiguish the use cases. The use-cases, and their specific integration guides are:

- [Transactions / Payments Acceptance](./Transaction%20Intents/Transaction%20Intent%20Integration%20Guide.md)
- [TT3 / Debicheck](./TT3%20Intents/TT3%20Intent%20Integration%20Guide.md)
