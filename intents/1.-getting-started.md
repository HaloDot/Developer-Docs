# Getting started with Intent

## 1. Intent Integration Methods

The Halo Dot Link application currently provides different mechanisms to integrate our payments solution depending on your use-case. The different methods are:

1. Android Intents Mechanism
2. Deeplinking Mechanism

Have a look at the image below as a guideline:

![Integration Mechanisms](<../assets/Android vs deeplinking.png>)

## 2. Intent Autherization

1. Retrieve your `Merchant ID` and `API Key` from the [Merchant Portal](https://go.merchantportal.prod.haloplus.io/).

**1. Retrieve details from the Merchant Portal**

_**Get Merchant ID**_

The `Merchant ID` can easily be found on the Halo Dot Go Merchant Portal. From the Merchant Portal, navigate to the Help Center Tab. There, under Try Deep Linking you will see your unique `Merchant ID`. See the screenshot below:

![Merchant Portal](<../assets/Merchant Portal.png>))

_**Get x-api-key**_

Right next to your `Merchant ID` on the Try Deep Linking page is the option to generate your `API Key`. Selecting this option will transfer you to the User Management Page:

![User Management Page](../assets/User%20Page.png)

Now you can generate a unique `API Key` for your user. Note the warning pop-up when generating an `API Key`.

Since an `API Key`is a sensitive value, it is stored as an encrypted value in our database and only presented in clear text once during the initial retrieval. It is the responsibility of the user to keep their `API Key` safe.

## 3. Intent Use Cases

With Halo Dot Link the exact same technology can be used for different use cases. However, the integration is slightly different to allow us to distinguish the use cases. The use cases, and their specific integration guides are:

* [Transactions / Payments Acceptance](transaction-intent-integration-guide.md)
* [TT3 / Debicheck](tt3-intent-integration-guide.md)
